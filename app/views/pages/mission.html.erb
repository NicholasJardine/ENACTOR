<p>Many graduated actors struggle to get representation because of
inexperience and many experienced actors don’t have representation.
Sometimes their look, race or even culture is not in demand at that
moment and miss out on a chance to get representation. Many
aspiring actors tend to give up, they don’t have an agent, or they don’t
have access to auditions. Additionally, actors go to countless
auditions and get no roles, feeling it’s a waste of time and money,
getting their hopes up and being let down.
We’re opening up the industry by making these auditions more
accessible, less costly to attend and giving upcoming actors a bigger
chance of being noticed. Additionally, auditions become easier for
companies to manage and provide a bigger range of options</p>

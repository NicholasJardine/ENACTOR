    <h1 class="mt-5">Enactor’s Terms of Service</h1>

    <h3>Welcome to Enactor!</h3>
    <p>Enactor creates products and services that enable people in the film and television industry to go about producing content in an easier and more authentic way. </p>
    <p>The terms below govern your use of the Enactor website/application.  </p>
    <p>We don’t charge actors to use Enactor or the other products and services covered by these Terms. We do, however, charge production companies for certain advanced features on the website. Additionally, businesses and organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Product/Website/application, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to the arts, film and television industry.
</p>
    <p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers. The only personal information shared to the public will be that which you choose to reveal on your profile.
However, if we suspect illegal activity, or the intention to use the website for criminal reasons, or suspect your profile is duplicated, we will use your information to directly contact you concerning the issue. </p>
<h5>The services we provide</h5>
    <p>Our mission is to give actors and production companies (marketing agencies, theatre companies, film productions) the ability to easily find the type of actor they wish to have in their projects, and to simplify the process of auditioning. To help them save both time and money.
To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:</p>
    <h6>Connect you with organizations who want to work with you:</h6>
    <p>Enactor works by giving production companies the ability to upload acting briefs and send it automatically to any actor, signed up to Enactor, that matches their brief specifications. It also gives them the ability to privately request an audition, and giving the actor a choice to either accept or deny that private request.
</p>

    <h6>Empower you to have control over your biography and profile, and your personal information.</h6>
    <p>By enabling you to regularly update contact information or your agent/representation, to specify how you would like to be contacted, and to regularly update the shows and productions you are in, to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you.</p>
    <h6>Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:</h6>
    <p>People will only join a service if they feel safe.
For every production company or agency that signs up to Enactor with the intention to audition, we will do a background check on the company to confirm their credibility. If we learn that they are not legitimate, we personally reserve the right to remove their profiles. </p>

    <p>If we suspect that an actors identity or profile is being duplicated in the app, we will remove the duplicated profile with the confirmation of the actor. If you suspect any criminal behaviour on the app, please contact us directly.
Enable global access to our services:
To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. </p>

<h5>How our services are funded</h5>
<p>Instead of actors and production companies paying to use Enactor and the other products and services we offer, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote. Please note that some features on the app will priced but it will not interrupt the process of auditioning, sending briefs or receiving them. </p>
    <h5>Your commitments to Enactor and the people that use it</h5>
    <p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments to create a trusted and professional environment.</p>
    <p>For this reason, it is compulsory that you:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Use the same name that you use in everyday life or your artist name widely known to the industry to make it easier for production companies to find you or find information about you.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate information about yourself in your bio, especially age, language and race.</li>
      <li>Create only one account (your own). If you’re having problems, contact Enactor. </li>
      <li>Not share your password, give access to your Enactor account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else. If your profile is managed by your agent, it should state so on your bio.</li>
      <li>The profiles of all actors below the age of 13 must be run by their parents or guardian (or agent) and must be specified in the biography, and the guardian/parent/agent must be present in the introduction of submitted video auditions stating their permission. It is also the duty of production companies to not accept audition tapes that do not have these permissions in the video submission.  </li>
      <li>No nudity is allowed in audition videos, and if a company reports your submission, your profile will be disabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can not use Enactor if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You are not a registered company, whether it be a theatre company, film, production, or television. This is to protect actors against being contacted by illegitimate companies. </li>
      <li>We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies. If your account has been disabled and you would like to query it, please contact us.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>What you can share and do on Enactor</h5>
    <p>We want actors to have control of how they want their biographies to read, their experiences, and private information. </p>
    <p>The actor’s profile, and the details they enter, will be available to everyone that chooses to search their names on the website to view their profiles. Of course, they can not be contacted by anyone viewing profiles, unless that company is registered and signed to Enactor and sends a brief through the website.</p>
    <p>The actor can upload multiple pictures, onto their profiles which can also be viewed by the public- however, no full nudity is allowed and your profile will be removed is such is detected.
We also discourage any foul language on the profile. </p>

    <p>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use of Enactor</li>
      <li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>
      <li>That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.</li>
      <li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.</li>
      <li>You may not access or collect data from Enactor using automated means or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.
If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.</p>

<h5>The permissions you give us</h5>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:</p>
<p>You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Enactor. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.</p>
<p>However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). </p>
<p>This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Enactor, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.</p>
<p>You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. </p>
<p>When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users, however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:</p>
<ul>

  <li>immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);</li>
  <li>your content has been used by production companies, once handed over, they have the right to download it</li>
  <li>where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:</li>
  <li>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);</li>
  <li>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or</li>
  <li> comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Additional provisions and legality</h5>
<p>1. Updating our Terms</p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.
We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Enactor community, you can delete your account at any time</p>
<p>2. Account suspension or termination</p>
<p>We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: </p>
<p>3. Limits on liability</p>
<p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>4. Disputes</p>
<p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. </p>
<p>In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>5. Other</p>
<ul>

  <li>Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>
  <li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</li>
  <li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
</ul>
<h5></h5>
<ul>
  <li>User Standards: These guidelines outline our standards regarding the content you post to Enactor and your activity on Enactor.</li>
  <li>Enactor Payment Terms: These terms apply to payments made on or through Enactor</li>
